<span data-l10n-id="53error">The HTTP UserAgent Cleaner extension not quite working correctly with FireFox version 53 and above. Fix it is impossible. FireFox developers make changes is completely inconsistent with an extension work. I recommended work with https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/ or FireFox 52.0.2 .
For long time use see https://www.torproject.org/ .

At now the Http-UserAgent developer cannot offer anything else.
Perhaps in 2018 year, such a replacement will appear, but nothing earlier than 2018 and nothing for FireFox. In the case that the replacement will appear, the news will be published in the rss feed at http://huac.8vs.ru/rss.php .
